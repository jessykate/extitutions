Social dynamics can be analysed and conceptualised from many different perspectives,  including economics, politics, law, sociology and social psychology. Different social ontological theories have been devised to analyse and comprehend these dynamics. 

Extitutional theory builds on [assemblage theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_theory) and suggests that institutions and extitutions are both just lenses on the same set of social dynamics. The theory contends these lenses are **normative constructions designed to see a specific set of ordering logics** which characterize but also limit the set of behaviours which can be reasoned about through that lens. By positioning institutions as a specific lens, we can also begin to construct other lenses, designed to look for categorically different ordering logics, yet which also exhibit properties of stable coherence and persistent dynamics. 

Extitutional theorists claim that some social phenomena are more richly described through other lenses, and in particular that the ‘extitutional’ lens looks at a set of social dynamics which are insufficiently addressed by most institutional frameworks, while also increasing in prevalence. 

Extitutions are not the opposite of institutions, nor are they a new type of institution. Rather, the extitutional lens focuses on the ways in which participation and mutual recognition pull people into alignment through local interactions. These local interactions constitute the basis for a distinct set of ordering dynamics, which are the focus of extitutional theory.

Establishing a theory of social dynamics beyond the existing institutional framework creates an opportunity to explore the specific properties and dynamics of both institutions and extitutions, as well as the interplay and dynamics between them. 

While institutions are characterized by constitutive rules and roles, Extitutions are characterised by people and the relationships amongst them. While rules and roles might also exist within an extitution, they are not constitutive elements of it. At the same time, people and relationships are a necessary but insufficient condition for the establishment of an extitution. Other factors need to be present, such as (gravity) and (participation) and (recognition).
